# Smart Rack Web Application

This is a web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Overview

The Smart Rack WebApp interfaces directly with a Firebase Realtime Database. It enables communication between the user and the ESP32 microcontroller managing the Smart Rack system. The ESP32 continuously monitors the database for updates and responds accordingly, executing predefined actions based on the current system state.

In addition, the ESP32 logs all actions under the `/logs/` path in the database, providing a comprehensive activity history and ensuring traceability of all operations.
